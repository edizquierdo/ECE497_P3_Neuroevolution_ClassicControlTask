P3a contains the code for a perceptron and then for a very simple neural network that builds from the perceptron. We also introduce a simple gradient descent method to train the neural network on a simple Input/Output task (XOR). This code was built in the recorded demos linked in the assignment.

P3b contains a few layers of refinement on the neural network code. We walked through this code in class on Monday, October 6th. In this folder, we also reintroduce the evolutionary algorithm and use it to train the network on a series of Input/Output tasks.

P3c integrates the neural network code, the evolutionary algorithm, now with a slightly modified version of the Braitenberg vehicle code, and we demonstrate how to evolve a neural network to solve our first EMBODIED task. 

P3d contains three classic control tasks: cart pole, inverted pendulum, and mountain cart. 

The P3cx and P3dx versions of these folders contain "solved" versions of these tasks, that you can use in whichever way you would like.
